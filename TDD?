Test-Driven Development (TDD) is important because it helps reduce bugs, improve code quality, and make maintenance easier. By writing tests before the actual code, developers can clearly define what the code is supposed to do and catch mistakes early. One of the biggest advantages of TDD is that it leads to cleaner and more organized code, since the code is written specifically to pass the tests. It also makes refactoring safer because the tests will immediately show if something breaks. In addition, the test cases act like living documentation that helps other developers understand how the code works. Although it might feel slower at first, in the long run TDD can actually speed up development by reducing the time spent on debugging and fixing unexpected issues.
